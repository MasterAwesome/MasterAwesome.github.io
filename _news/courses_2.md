1. TA for SoftVulnSec. I created rubrics and formed a CTF team [bout_to_get_flagged](https://ctftime.org/team/117566). We were #35 in USA at one point and played with the #1 team in Brazil; [fireshellst](https://ctftime.org/team/25526/)
2. Team disbanded after everyone got busy but got some cool merch from [MetaCTF](https://metactf.com/) before that :)
3. Started internship with Qualcomm working on code that runs on a type-2 hypervisor and worked on the interaction from one VM to other.
4. Played CTF at Qualcomm and was #1 across United States and Indian teams.

# Courses
1. Foundations of Artificial intelligence
2. Computer systems

# Other
1. TA for Theory of Computation. This was quite fun as my math background wasn't the greatest but I really enjoy the math that goes into finite state machines. Simple yet beautiful. 10/10
2. Got an offer from Qualcomm for me to join them as a full-time employee in January 2020.
3. Went back to India bearing gifts. India at that point seemed completely unbothered by COVID. Guess we know where that will head.
